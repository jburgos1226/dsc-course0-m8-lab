# Aviation Accident Analysis
Key Findings
Large aircraft demonstrate significantly better safety outcomes than small aircraft, with a mean fatal/serious injury fraction of 0.1149 compared to 0.1910 for small aircraft (nearly 40% improvement).
Manufacturer Recommendations
Small Aircraft (â‰¤20 passengers)
Top Recommended:

Bombardier - Best performer (0.0843 injury fraction)
McDonnell Douglas - Second-best (0.0900 injury fraction)
Boeing - Strong safety record (0.0533 injury fraction)

Avoid: Grumman, Stinson, and Maule show high variability and concerning injury rates.
Large Aircraft (>20 passengers)
Top Recommended:

McDonnell Douglas - Outstanding record (0.0079 injury fraction)
Bombardier - Consistently low rates (0.0263-0.0314 injury fraction)
Boeing - Solid performance with extensive operational history

Key Insights

Small aircraft show highly variable safety outcomes between manufacturers
Large aircraft demonstrate consistent safety performance across all manufacturers
Destruction rate paradox: Large aircraft have higher destruction rates but better passenger survival due to superior safety systems
Modern large aircraft safety systems effectively protect passengers even in severe incidents

Conclusions

Choose large aircraft over small aircraft when safety is primary concern
Bombardier and McDonnell Douglas offer superior safety performance across categories
Small aircraft selection requires careful manufacturer evaluation due to high outcome variability
Regulatory frameworks for large aircraft appear highly effective at ensuring consistent safety standards
